# Single Source Shortest Paths in a directed graph
In this project we find the shortest paths from a souce vertex to all other vertices in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
The graph is provided in a text file named "Graph.txt" in adjacency list representation. Every line represents a vertex followed by pairs of all the vertices adjacent to it, and the respective edge lengths, separated with tabs.
A test file of a small graph is also provided in "test1.txt".
An output file named "ShortestPaths.txt" is generated that has the list of the vertices with there shortest paths from the source.

Instructions to run the project:
1)  Clone this repository on your local machine.
2)  Add your input text file to the folder (the graph in your input file should have the format same as the one in "Graph.txt")
3)  Specify the name of your input file in the file "main.py" on line 3.
4)  Specify the source vertex in the file "main.py" on line 5.
5)  If you wish to print the debug messages, set the value of 'debug' to 'True' on line 6 in file "main.py"
6)  Run the file "main.py".
7)  Check the file "ShortestPaths.txt" for the output.
